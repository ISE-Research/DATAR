# DATAR
The DATAR dataset, is designed to track the characteristics of open-source Android app releases, like popularity ratings, and the social and technical factors that affect them. The dataset comprises two types of information: app-related and release-related, with the majority collected from the Google Play and GitHub platforms. Additionally, our dataset includes several source code attributes (e.g., number of activities, cyclomatic complexity) that have proven effective in previous research, extracted from the APK files and their source code. This dataset contains information from 8,031 releases of 1,354 Android open-source apps, each having at least one compatible published release on Google Play and GitHub.
